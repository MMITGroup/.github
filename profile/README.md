**Magnetic Measurement and Imaging Technology (MMIT) @ TU Braunschweig**

Developing next-generation magnetic technologies for biomedical imaging, diagnostics, and therapy. We work with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) to build radiation-free imaging systems (like Magnetic Particle Imaging), ultra-sensitive bioassays (via Magnetic Particle Spectroscopy), and magnetic hyperthermia platforms for localized drug delivery. Our research spans custom hardware, signal processing, and magnetic nanoparticle physics to enable real-time, quantitative, and non-invasive medical and industrial applications.
